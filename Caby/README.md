# Caby - The bytecode interpreter

## Bytecode file format

Bytecode is split into three parts

### Constant pool

This is a table of constant values that will not change in the program. Following items are located here:
#### Constant pool objects
- String
`0x01 | length - 4 bytes | the string`
The string is NOT zero terminated.
- Function
`0x00 | name - 4 bytes index to constant pool | parameters count - 1 byte | code length (in instructions) - 4 bytes | code ...`
There probably should be serialized local variables...
- Class, method and member variable
- Enum
- TBD...

Size of constant pool is 2^32 (so it can be indexed by 32bit int).

### Entry point

Constant pool index (4 bytes) at which the global function body is located.

## Bytecode oppcodes
- push_short = 0x01 | 2B Num
- push_int   = 0x02 | 4B Num
- push_long  = 0x03 | 8B Num  
Used for pushing int literals onto the operand stack.

- push_bool  = 0x04 | 1B boolean  
Pushes boolean literal onto the operand stack

- push_literal = 0x05 | 4B Index to constant pool  
Used for pushing other values onto the operand stack (references to objects, strings...)

- push_none = 0x20
Pushes None (Unit) value onto the stack.

- get_local = 0x06 | 2B Index to local frame  
Push the value of a local variable onto the stack

- set_local = 0x07 | 2B Index to local frame  
Pop a value from the operand stack and write it into the given local frame

- call_func = 0x08 | 4B Index to constant pool | 1B Arguments count  
Calls a function (not an object method) at given constant pool index.
Pops arguments of an operand stack

- ret = 0x09  
Exits the function.

- label = 0x00  
Does nothing, acts as a helper in dissasembly. When executed in code,
only bumps the IP.

- jmp_short = 0x0A | 2B address
- jmp = 0x0B | 4B address
- jmp_long = 0x0C | 8B address  
Unconditional jump, address is **BYTE** offset (not the number of instruction) to which to jump

- branch_short = 0x0D | 2B address
- branch = 0x0E | 4B address
- branch_long = 0x0F | 8B address  
Conditional jump, pops value from stack, if it is *truthy*, then the jump will be performed.

- branch_false_short - 0x2D | 2B address
- branch_false - 0x2E | 4B address
- branch false_long - 0x0F | 8B address

- print 0x10 | 1B argument count  
Prints an interpolated string `print "Hello there, {}" "General Kenobi"`
Pops arguments from stack and tries to replace `{}` in the string with it.

- drop 0x11
Drops first value from the stack.

- dropn - 0x25 | 1B count
Drops first 'count' values from the stack.

- dup 0x12
Pops value from the stack and then pushes this value twice on top of the stack

- get_global 0x13 | 4B index to constant pool
Push the value of a global variable which name is stored in constant pool to the top stack
- set_global 0x14 | 4B index to constant pool
Pop value from the top of the stack and assign it into variable which name is equal to the constant pool string indexed.
- def_val_global 0x15 | 4B index to constant pool
Defines a new immutable global variable. The cp index points to a string which is the variable name. Last byte signals if the value is mutable.
- def_var_global 0x16 | 4B index to constant pool
Defines a new mutable global variable. The cp index points to a string which is the variable name. Last byte signals if the value is mutable.

#### Arithmetic operations
- iadd 0x30
- isub 0x31
- imul 0x32
- idiv 0x33
- irem 0x34
- iand 0x35
- ior  0x36
- ieq  0x3b
Arithmetic operations on integers, pop two from the stack, perform operation, push the result.

NOTE: Bitwise operations will be added later.

# Implementation details
## Local variables
Local variables have their own array. It has 65536(2^16) slots. So there can be at most 65536 local variables
in the whole program accross all function calls. This should be fine, stack overflow would probably happen
sooner than you running out of local variables.

Best solution was to keep them on the stack, but this is tricky with the block expression, since they do not
immediately not follow each other. For example
```
var x = 1;
if (true && {var y = x == 1; y}) {
    ...
}
```
There is the `true` expression between x and y. This can be solved by simulating the stack offset in compilation.
Also, the last value on the stack is not the return value of the block, because there is the local variables sitting there.
